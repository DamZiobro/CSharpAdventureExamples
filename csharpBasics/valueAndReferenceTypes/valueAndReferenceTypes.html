C# is language which operates with two kind of types:
<ul>
    <li><i>value type</i> - type where only one space of memory is allocated. It is related for primitive C# types like: int, char, float, bool etc. as well as 
                     for struct types. If you copy value type to another type new instance of object will be created.</li>
    <li><i>reference type</i> - type related to class objects. When we are declaring such class object, two memory spaces are being allocated. Object of class type and 
                     reference for such object. If you copy reference type to another reference type, only reference is being coping. It means that both references
                     will be able to operate (ex. modify) the same object. Threfore when we modify object using one reference and will try to get its fields values
                     using second reference, fields will have values after modification. As opposed to C++, there is possible to create reference type 
                     being not related to any object - null reference. Reference types in C# are very similar to pointers in C++.</li>
</ul>

Let's see example before for better understanding:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/7807615.js"></script>
Output of this example is:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xmementoit/7807642.js"></script>

In point I we are declaring class TestClass which will be base for our reference type object.<br /><br />
In point II we are declaring struct TestStruct which will be base for our value type object.<br /><br />
Point III presents initialization and assigning basic values for three different objects: 
<ul>
    <li>class type object being reference type object</li>
    <li>struct type object being value type object</li>
    <li>primitive type (int type) object being value type object</li>
</ul>
and displaying value of our objects in point IV.
Point V is key point of this example. Here we are passing our objects to the function and trying to modify its values there 
in order to check difference between reference type and value type.<br /><br />
Point VI prints values of our objects after invoking changeValuesOfClassAndStruct() function.<br /><br />
As you can see value of class type is being changed, while values of struct types and int type are not being changed. It is because 
default parameters passing to the function in C# is passing by value. This means we are copying object which we are passing to the function and copy of such object
is being visible only withing function. <br /><br />
However when we are passing reference type object we are passing reference to 
our object by value (copying reference to object - creating second reference to object), which allows as to see modified objects after exiting function 
 using first reference to the object. So second copy of our reference is visible only withing function, but thanks to first copy of reference to the same
 object which is visible outside the function we can see modified object outside of function.<br /><br />

Reference and value types are one of major basic concepts which every C# developer should understand. This concept sometimes confuses people switching 
to C# from C++ programming language, where reference to object always have is marked using '&' character. In C# it is not required - instead we need to remember
that every class type is reference type.
